## Q.Difference between Class in c++ and JavaScript
Certainly! Classes in C++ and JavaScript are used for similar purposes â€” they provide a blueprint for creating objects, but they differ in syntax, behavior, and how they are implemented within their respective languages.

Classes in C++
Syntax:
class MyClass {
public:
    // Member variables and functions
    int memberVariable;
    void memberFunction() {
        // Function definition
    }
};
Key Points:
In C++, classes are used to define the structure and behavior of objects.
They encapsulate data members (variables) and member functions (methods) within a single unit.
Classes facilitate data hiding and encapsulation by using access specifiers (public, private, protected).
Objects are created based on classes and can have various instances with their own set of member variables and functions.
Classes in JavaScript
Syntax (ES6+):
javascript
Copy code
class MyClass {
    constructor() {
        // Constructor logic
    }

    // Member methods
    memberFunction() {
        // Function definition
    }
}
Key Points:
In JavaScript, classes were introduced in ES6 to mimic the class-based syntax known from other languages.
JavaScript classes are syntactical sugar over prototype-based inheritance, providing a more familiar way to define objects and deal with inheritance.
They can contain a constructor method that is called when an object is instantiated using the new keyword.
Member methods are defined within the class and can be accessed by instances created from the class.
Key Differences:
Syntax: C++ classes use a more traditional syntax, where member functions and variables are explicitly declared within the class scope. JavaScript classes, especially in ES6+, adopt a more class-like syntax but are fundamentally still using prototype-based inheritance under the hood.

Underlying Mechanism: C++ classes are directly supported by the language and are used for defining object blueprints, encapsulating data, and methods. JavaScript classes are a syntactical abstraction over the existing prototypal inheritance in JavaScript, providing a more familiar way for developers coming from class-based languages.

Inheritance: In C++, classes support classical inheritance where subclasses inherit from a base class using a hierarchical structure. In JavaScript, classes inherit properties and methods from other classes via prototype chains, as JavaScript primarily uses prototypal inheritance.

Access Control: C++ supports access specifiers (public, private, protected) to control member access. JavaScript classes have less rigid access control; traditionally, JavaScript used naming conventions (_variable for private) rather than strict enforcement.

Both C++ and JavaScript classes serve the purpose o \f creating objects based on blueprints, but their syntax, underlying mechanisms, and inheritance models differ significantly due to the nature of their respective languages.

## 4 pillars->Abstraction,Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism

## Note: Concept of class were intoduced in ES6 before that there were

````JS
function user(userName,roll,no){
  this.userName=userName;
  this.roll=roll;
  this.no=no;
  
  return this;
}

const user1=user("roiy",89,9);
console.log(user1)


````
## Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step:

## Function user(userName, roll, no)
This function defines a constructor function in JavaScript. Constructor functions are used to create objects with a blueprint defined within the function.

## Parameters:
userName: Represents the username of the user.
roll: Represents some roll number associated with the user.
no: Represents a number related to the user.
Inside the function:

this.userName = userName;: Assigns the value of userName passed to the userName property of the created object.
this.roll = roll;: Assigns the value of roll passed to the roll property of the created object.
this.no = no;: Assigns the value of no passed to the no property of the created object.
return this;: This line is unnecessary in a constructor function because JavaScript automatically returns the created object when using the new keyword.
Object creation
javascript
Copy code
const user1 = user("roiy", 89, 9);
Here, you're invoking the user function (which is acting as a constructor function) without the new keyword. This means this inside the function will point to the global object (window in a browser, global in Node.js) instead of creating a new object.

This will result in unexpected behavior because this refers to the global object, and properties (userName, roll, no) will be assigned to the global object.

Explanation and Correction
To properly create an object using the constructor function user, you should use the new keyword:

javascript
Copy code
const user1 = new user("roiy", 89, 9);

This way, a new object will be created and assigned to user1, with properties userName, roll, and no initialized accordingly.

After fixing this, user1 will be an object like this:
{
  userName: "roiy",
  roll: 89,
  no: 9
}
And when you log user1, it will display this object in the console.

Remember, the new keyword is crucial when using constructor functions in JavaScript to create objects.

## Note: Concept of class were intoduced in ES6 Before the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), JavaScript used constructor functions and prototypes to create objects and simulate object-oriented programming concepts. Here's an example of how objects were created before ES6 using constructor functions:
```js
// Constructor function
function Person(firstName, lastName, age) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.age = age;
}

// Adding a method to the prototype
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  return 'Hello, I am ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName + '!';
};

// Creating objects using the constructor function
let person1 = new Person('John', 'Doe', 30);
let person2 = new Person('Jane', 'Smith', 25);

// Accessing object properties and invoking method
console.log(person1.firstName); // Output: John
console.log(person2.age); // Output: 25
console.log(person1.greet()); // Output: Hello, I am John Doe!
```

## This approach relies on prototypes for inheritance and defining methods, allowing multiple objects to share methods without duplicating them for each instance.

## ES6 introduced the class syntax, which provides a more familiar and cleaner way to define classes and create objects in JavaScript. However, under the hood, classes in ES6 still use prototypes and constructor functions to achieve inheritance and object creation.

## Diffrence between constructor of c++ and JS
In JavaScript, constructors are functions used with the new keyword to create objects.
They are regular functions that are used as a blueprint to create objects. They are invoked with the new keyword.
Constructors in JavaScript often use this to refer to the object being created.
JavaScript doesn't have classes (prior to ES6), but constructor functions can be used as a way to create objects and simulate class-like behavior.
JavaScript doesn't have method overloading. You can define default values or handle different cases within the constructor function itself.
Key Differences:
Syntax: C++ constructors are defined within classes and have the same name as the class. JavaScript constructors are regular functions that can be used as object blueprints.

## Working step of new
The new keyword in JavaScript is used to create an instance of an object, especially when dealing with constructor functions or classes. When you use new in JavaScript, several steps are carried out to create the object:

Memory Allocation: When you use new, JavaScript allocates memory for a new object instance.

New Object Creation: The new keyword initializes a new, empty object.

Setting Prototype: The [[Prototype]] (also known as __proto__ in some environments) of the newly created object is set to the prototype property of the constructor function or class being used. This linkage enables the new object to inherit properties and methods from its constructor's prototype.

Setting 'this' Context: The constructor function or class's code is executed with this referencing the newly created object. This allows the constructor to initialize the object's properties and perform any necessary setup.

Implicit Return: If the constructor doesn't explicitly return an object, the newly created object is returned automatically by the new keyword.

## instanceof
The instanceof operator in JavaScript is used to check if an object belongs to a particular class or constructor function. It checks the prototype chain to determine whether an object is an instance of a specific class or its parent classes in the inheritance hierarchy.

## Difference between object in c++ and JavaScript.
Objects in C++ and JavaScript differ significantly in their nature, usage, and implementation due to the distinct paradigms of the languages.

Objects in C++
Structure:
In C++, objects are instances of classes.
They are instances of user-defined types created using the class keyword.
Features:
Objects in C++ are based on the concept of classes and have a fixed structure defined by the class.
They can contain member variables (data members) and member functions.
Access specifiers (public, private, protected) determine the visibility of members within the class.
Object creation typically involves memory allocation and constructor invocation.
C++ objects can employ encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, following the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).
Objects in JavaScript
Structure:
In JavaScript, objects are dynamic collections of key-value pairs.
They are instances of classes (introduced in ES6) or created using constructor functions (in pre-ES6 JavaScript).
Features:
Objects in JavaScript are based on a prototype-based model.
They consist of properties (keys) and associated values (can be any data type or even functions).
Objects can be created directly using object literals {}, with new Object(), or with constructor functions like function SomeObject() {}.
JavaScript objects are highly dynamic; properties can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime.
JavaScript objects support prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and behaviors from other objects through their prototypes.

## prototype behaviour of javascript

In JavaScript, the prototype property plays a fundamental role in the prototype-based inheritance model. Understanding prototype behavior is crucial to comprehend how objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.

Prototype Property:
Function Prototype:

Every function in JavaScript has a prototype property by default. This property is an object (often referred to as the prototype object) and is used as a blueprint for objects created using that function as a constructor.

Instance Prototype (__proto__ or [[Prototype]]):
Each object in JavaScript has a special internal property called __proto__ (also known as [[Prototype]]). It references the object's prototype from which it inherits properties.
Prototypal Inheritance:
When an object is created using a constructor function or a class, its __proto__ property points to the prototype property of its constructor function.

When an object needs to access a property or method, JavaScript looks for it on the object itself. If it's not found, JavaScript follows the __proto__ chain upwards until it finds the property or until it reaches the end of the chain (the Object.prototype).

Behavior of Prototypes:
Property Lookup:

When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript looks for it on the object first. If not found, it checks the object's __proto__ (its prototype) and continues up the chain until it finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain.
Modifying Prototypes:

Modifying the prototype object reflects in the instances that inherit from it. Any changes made to the prototype are immediately visible to the instances that inherit from it.

Instance-specific Properties:
Properties assigned directly to an instance don't affect its prototype or other instances. If a property is present on both the instance and its prototype, the instance property takes precedence.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
``````JS
function Vehicle(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
}

Vehicle.prototype.start = function() {
    return `Starting the ${this.make} ${this.model}`;
};

const car = new Vehicle('Toyota', 'Corolla');

console.log(car.start()); // Output: "Starting the Toyota Corolla"
``````

In this example, Vehicle.prototype is the prototype object for instances created by the Vehicle constructor function.
The start method is added to Vehicle.prototype, and the car instance inherits this method through its prototype chain.
Understanding prototype behavior in JavaScript is crucial for utilizing inheritance, creating efficient code structures, and leveraging the language's object-oriented capabilities based on the prototype chain.
